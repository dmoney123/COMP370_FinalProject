Question Formulation

1) Is North American coverage of zohran mamdani positive or negative and what topics does the coverage focus on

    notes: 
    
    very vauge, we wont have any topics,
    nor do we have any idea about the type of media sources we want to focus on, or the scale/region of that 
    essentially doesnt answer any fundamental question (for the media company), lets work on refining that

    value provided to media company:

    not much, just some random information at the moment


2) Is the coverage by national right-leaning media outlets of zohran mamdani positive or negative, and what topics does the coverage focus on

    notes:

        choosing national right wing media outlets is a natural choice, as it is implied that the left wing speaks about ZM positively (could also do the opposite). Will need to do secondary research on prominant right-wing outlets
        next steps are to refine how we define positive or negative, topics category

    value provided to media company:

        Tells them about the right wing media coverage of ZM

3) What percentage of coverage by North American national right-leaning media outlets of zohran mamdani is positive, negative or neutral? What are the 3-8 most prominant topics focused on by this coverage

    notes:
        starting to refine how we are going to classify positive or negative coverage (percentage) - this is going to need some more work and need a comprehensive typology to define positive / negative

    value provided to media company:

        They can use this information to determine what the right wing is saying about this politician, and how consumers of right wing media's opinions are being shaped. This can provide value to the media team



*this is one potential route we can go to get even more specific with the question and provide more value to the media company

4) Before and after the NYC mayoral election, what percentage of coverage by North American national right-leaning media outlets of zohran mamdani is positive, negative or neutral? What are the 3-8 most prominant topics focused on by this coverage

    notes:
        adding an actual time frame (ie this week (post election) versus last month (before the election))
        Can extend further and analyze the topics that have been discussed before and after the election.

    value:
        Can provide insight into the shift in the right-wings opinion of ZM that has occured before and after the election
